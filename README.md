## Implementation Details

### Splash Screen (SplashActivity)
The splash screen features multiple animations on the logo:

```java
logo = findViewById(R.id.logo);
logo.animate().rotation(360f).setDuration(2000);
logo.animate().scaleX(0.5f).scaleY(0.5f).setDuration(3000);
logo.animate().translationYBy(1000f).setDuration(2000);
logo.animate().alpha(0f).setDuration(6000);
```
rotation(360f): Rotates the logo 360 degrees
scaleX(0.5f).scaleY(0.5f): Scales the logo to half its size
translationYBy(1000f): Moves the logo 1000 pixels down
alpha(0f): Fades out the logo
### Adapter Implementation
The custom adapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter and implements filtering:
```java
public class PlayerAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<PlayerAdapter.ViewHolder> implements Filterable {
    // Implementation details
}
```
